# Face Recognition Using Eigenfaces

This repository contains my Google Colab implementation for face recognition using the Eigenfaces/PCA method.

## How to use

Download the notebook and open it in Google Colab. Instructions and workflow are inside the notebook.

## Dataset

This code uses the Yale Face Database, which must be downloaded separately from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olgabelitskaya/yale-face-database

## Testing with Unknown Images

Unknown face and non-face images used in this project are not included and should be supplied by the user. You can test the notebook by providing your own images not present in the Yale Face Database.
